We are both first-year students, and while we’re still early in our journey, our vision is clear: to create a platform where users can access research papers—both paid and open-access—by staking the EDU token. Users will also be rewarded in VED tokens based on the time they spend reading papers, encouraging active engagement and learning.

Inspired by the vision of Open Campus to build a decentralized online university, we imagine users accessing these papers as Open Campus students. For paid papers, the content will be acquired under the name of the organization, and we understand that licensing and copyright will require formal negotiation with publishers. Since this platform is still in its early stages, we haven’t approached any organizations yet—but we’re confident in our direction and are seeking guidance from experienced developers to bring it to life.

So far, we’ve implemented core features like reading, staking, rewards, and sector-based voting. EDU tokens staked on the platform will have a minimum locking period of 2 weeks.

We believe this project not only supports EduChain’s ecosystem but also aligns perfectly with its long-term vision of decentralized education.
If the website work well then we will further add some more functionality so that professional research paper writers can also publish here on this platform.
